When a dependent variable has more than two categories and the values of each category have a
meaningful sequential order where a value is indeed ‘higher’ than the previous one, then you
can use ordinal logit. 

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
