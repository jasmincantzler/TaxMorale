##### Jasmin Cantzler & Wiebke Weiger

This repository contains all the information and documents related to the collaborative research project and the individual "sub-assignments".

* The folder **Assignment 2** contains all information and documents related to the second pair assignment, i.e. our proposal for the final research project:
  * R-Markdown file containing the proposal
  * HTML-, and pdf-files knitted from the R-Markdown file
  * a bib-file "References" containing the references from the proposal
  * other documents or data used for this assignment (e.g. map of countries included in the dataset)
* The folder **Assignment3** contains all information and documents related to the third pair assignment (i.e. merged data and basic inferential statistics)
* The folder **Final Project** contains all the relevant information and documents for the final collaborative research project
* 

Assignment 2:
*The second pair assignment is a proposal for your Collaborative Research Project. It is an opportunity for you to layout your collaborative research paper question, justify why it is interesting, provide basic literature review (properly cited using BibTeX), and identify data sources/methodologies that you can access to help answer your question. You will also demonstrate your understanding of literate programming technologies.* **Deadline 23 October**, *2,000 words maximum, 10% of final grade.*

Assignment 2:
*In the third pair assignment you will gather web based data from at least two sources, merge the data sets, conduct basic descriptive and inferential statistics on the data to address a relevant research question and briefly describe the results including with dynamically generated tables and figures. Students are encouraged to access data and perform statistical analyses with an eye to answering questions relevant for their Collaborative Research Project.* **Deadline 13 November**, *the write up should be 1,500 words maximum and use literate programming, 10% of final grade.*

Final Project:
*For the Collaborative Research Project you will pose an interesting social science question and attempt to answer it using standard academic practices including original data collection and statistical analysis. The project should be considered a ‘dry run’ for your thesis. The project has three presentation outputs designed to present your research to multiple audiences. The first is a oral presentation (10 minute maximum) given in the final class. The second is a standard academic paper (5,000 words maximum) that is fully reproducible and dynamically generated. The third is a website designed to present key aspects of your research in an engaging way to a general audience. The paper and website are **due in the Final Exam Week**. The presentation and website are each worth 10% of your final mark. The paper is worth 30%.*
